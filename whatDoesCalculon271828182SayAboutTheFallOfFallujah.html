    In this example, with the news of the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22Fall+of+Fallujah%22">"Fall of Fallujah"</a>, our rulers wish us not to recall the similar <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22Fall+of+Saigon%22">"Fall of Saigon"</a>, whose anniversay is coming in April, that was so embarassing to them.

  All of this matters to me because as we approach likely <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=near+term+human+extinction">near term human extinction</a>,
  we are also exploding up the learning curve in so many sciences, thanks to so many smart individuals with vision who push back the frontiers and then share current research on the intertubes with us.

  Collapse is coming.  Who knows how long <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=TPTB">
  TPTB</a> can keep the balls in the air. Pretty damn impressive so far. Best case is the end of industrial civilization. But then there will no coolant circulating in the 400 some odd reactors around the world that take decades and billions to decommission <i>each</i> ... how does life survive with that much ionizing radiation around?

  But we were so close! In ten, twenty years tops, we'd have figured out how to use the <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?tbs=li:1#q=bitcoin+falkvinge&amp;tbm=vid&amp;tbs=qdr:y">
  bitcoin platform</a> to organize networks from the bottom up, for the many fewer humans who will remain -- we'd make the best possible out of the circumstances. And this guy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jygJe8gNxU4">
  Rick Falkvinge</a> knows how to do that.

You wonder about climate change?  You remember what a normal jet stream looked like from over the north pole? Here it is now, in <a href="http://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/isobaric/250hPa/orthographic=90.00,90.00,500">real time, directly over the pole</a>.
It is <a href="http://earth.nullschool.net/">interactive and awesome</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  And cuts through all the bullshit. Look at it. The global climate system is moving into a new basin of attraction. At the bottom of that basin global temperature differences are evened out. However roundabout, we are headed to the bottom of that pit, potentially taking all life with us.

  <p>
  The IPPC reports were and are understandably conservative, given how they've been attacked ("hocky stick", "climategate", etc).
  </p>

  <p>
  The 4'th report, in 2007, was based on linear feedback only and predictions were made on what would happen next.  Because of the several years deadline for gathering data for the pending IPPC report, already some of the predictions were exceeded by the time the report was actually released to the public.
  </p>

  <p>
  In the time since, satellite sensors and computational models and field work (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx1Jxk6kjbQ">Natalia Shakhova</a>, especially--I love you Natalia!) have increased in sophistication and it is obvious that a linear model is no longer appropriate.
  </p>
  <p>
  Based on the difference in predictions of the 2007 IPCC report and data collected since, second order non-linearities were introduced into the models and the results are in: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/runawayglobalwarming/the-non-disclosed-extreme-arctic-methane-threat">

  <blockquote>
<i>"""<br>
The best estimate of the time that methane eruption in the Arctic will produce a mean atmospheric temperature of 8¬∞C leading to total global deglaciation and the major extinction of all life on Earth (IPCC, 2007) is 2050.6 +- 3.4 (N=8) with a total range from 2042.2 to 2052.8 (Figures 1 and 2, Tables 1a - 1d, Table 2).

methane release will cause the oceans to begin boiling off between 115¬∞C and 120¬∞C (Severson, 2013) in 2080 and the Earth's atmosphere will have reached temperatures equivalent to those on Venus by 2096
<br>"""
<br>"""<br>
The newly determined atmospheric temperature gradient indicates that the mean global atmospheric temperature will reach 1.5¬∞C in 15 years (2028.5) and 2¬∞C in 20 years (2033.4). <b>Consequently we only have 15 years to get an efficient

  <p>
  Now, undoubtedly higher order effects will also kick in that will make this prediction inaccurate in some ways, but it is the best we have to go on, and we have 15 years to avoid runaway global warming.
  </p>
  <p>
  We need to work together more than ever before, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lucovsky">
