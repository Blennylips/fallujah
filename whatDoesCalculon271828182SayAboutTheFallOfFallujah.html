  Which, by the way, was labelled: "deformed Fallujah child from US chemical weapon use."

  All of this matters to me because as we approach likely <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=near+term+human+extinction">near term human extinction</a>
  , we are also exploding up the learning curve in so many sciences, thanks to so many smart individuals with vision who share and give us the best information to deal with the wreckage of late stage capitalism, predator style.

  Collapse is coming.  Who knows how long TPTB can keep the balls in the air. Pretty damn impressive so far. Best case is the end of industrial civilization. But then there will no coolant circulating in the 400 some odd reactors around the world that take decades and billions to decommission <i>each</i> ... how does life survive with that much ionizing radiation around?

  But we were so close! In ten, twenty years tops, we'd have figured out how to use the <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?tbs=li:1#q=bitcoin+falkvinge&amp;tbm=vid&amp;tbs=qdr:y">
  bitcoin platform</a> to organize networks from the bottom up, for the many fewer humans who will remain -- we'd make the best possible out of the circumstances. And this guy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jygJe8gNxU4">
  Rick Falkvinge</a> knows how to do that.

  The seeds of the solutions to our problems are out there now, roaming the <a href="http://www.memosphere.com/home.html">

You wonder about climate change?  You remember what a normal jet stream looked like from over the north pole? Here it is now, in <a href="http://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/isobaric/250hPa/orthographic=90.00,90.00,500">real time, directly over the pole</a>.
It is <a href="http://earth.nullschool.net/">interactive and awesome</a>.

  <p>
  And cuts through all the bullshit. Look at it. The global climate system is moving into a new basin of attraction. At the bottom of that basin global temperature differences are evened out.

  <p>
  The IPPC reports were and are understandably conservative, given how they've been attacked ("hocky stick", "climategate", etc).
  </p>

  <p>
  The 4'th report, in 2007, was based on linear feedback only and predictions were made on what would happen next.  Because of the several years deadline for gathering data for the pending IPPC report, already some of the predictions were exceeded by the time the report was actually released to the public.
  </p>

  <p>
  In the time since, satellite sensors and computational models and field work (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx1Jxk6kjbQ">Natalia Shakhova</a>, especially) have increased in sophistication and it is obvious that a linear model is no longer appropriate.
  </p>
  <p>
  Based on the difference in predictions of the 2007 IPCC report and data collected since, second order non-linearities were introduced into the models and the results are in: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/runawayglobalwarming/the-non-disclosed-extreme-arctic-methane-threat">

  And that's my opinion.  Of course I could be wrong.<br><br>
